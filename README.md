# WeatherNueralNetwork

This project applies a Neural Network in order to predict the weather given a multitude of parameters. The goal of this project is to compare how a neural network compares the Mean-Squared-Error
of this model to the Mean-Squared Error of both Random Forest Classifier and Bagging Classifier (SVC).
