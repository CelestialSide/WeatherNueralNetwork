# WeatherNueralNetwork
I've been told to do something interesting with a Neural Network so I wanted to see if I could improve on a dataset that
I've already used before, a weather classification dataset, after getting the dataset into a readable format for the machine
learning. I noticed after running for at first 10 epochs but later 50 that the mean squared error reduced to about 0.8 and 
flickers around, as such while the neural network was not able to outperform either the bagging classifier or the random
forest it did manage to get quite close.
