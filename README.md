# WeatherNueralNetwork
I've been told to do something interesting with a Neural Network so I wanted to see if I could improve on a dataset that
I've already used before. The dataset I wished to improve accuracy on was a weather classification dataset.
After getting the dataset into a readable format for the machine learning, I began testing an Artificial Neural Network Model.
I noticed after running for at first 10 epochs but later 50 that the mean squared error reduced to about 0.8 and begins to
bounce around the number, as such while the neural network was not able to outperform either the bagging classifier (Using SVC) or the random
forest it did manage to get quite close.
